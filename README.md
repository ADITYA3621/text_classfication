This script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and scikit-learn's logistic regression for classification.Script with 100 articles for training and testing, with 90% accuracy and 30% testing size of data.

# Scraping and Classification Application

This is a simple application that demonstrates web scraping, text cleaning, and text classification using machine learning. The application scrapes data from a website, cleans the text, and uses a logistic regression model to classify the text into different categories.

# Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (with dependencies)
Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Install Python depencies using:

pip install (dependency name)

# Website URL

You may need to inspect the HTML structure of your target website and adjust these selectors accordingly.

# execution
run the application using either run icon on jupyter notebook or by giving path of file with cmd command python text_classification.py

#evaluation report
The evaluation report will be stored in the "scrapped_data" folder as evaluation_report.csv.
